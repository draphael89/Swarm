# Brave Search

Web search and content extraction using the official Brave Search API. No browser required.

## Setup

Requires a Brave Search API account with a free subscription. A credit card is required to create the free subscription (you won't be charged).

1. Create an account at https://api-dashboard.search.brave.com/register
2. Create a "Free AI" subscription
3. Create an API key for the subscription
4. Configure `BRAVE_API_KEY` in the app Settings → Environment Variables.
   (Fallback for standalone usage: export `BRAVE_API_KEY` in your shell.)
5. Dependencies are installed via the backend workspace package.
   If running this skill standalone, install once from this skill directory:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Search

```bash
./search.js "query"                         # Basic search (5 results)
./search.js "query" -n 10                   # More results (max 20)
./search.js "query" --content               # Include page content as markdown
./search.js "query" --freshness pw          # Results from last week
./search.js "query" --freshness 2024-01-01to2024-06-30  # Date range
./search.js "query" --country DE            # Results from Germany
